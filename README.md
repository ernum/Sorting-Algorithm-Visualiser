# Visualising Sorting Algorithms with Python

In this project, I've created demos visualising six different sorting algorithms. The main goal is to make it simple for beginner programmers to comprehend sorting algorithms. The secondary goal is to create an interface that's easy to understand and play around with. Some basic information about each implemented sorting algorithm can be seen below, and more future additions should be expected!

| Name | Average Time Complexity | Worst Time Complexity |
| - | - | - |
| Quick Sort |  O(nlog(n)) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Merge Sort | O(nlog(n)) | O(nlog(n)) |
| Selection Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Heap Sort | O(nlog(n)) | O(nlog(n)) |
| Insertion Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Bubble Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
